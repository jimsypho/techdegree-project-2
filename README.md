 ## List Pagination
 
 This is my second project in Team Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript TechDegree.  It is written in vanilla JavaScript and focuses on DOM manipulation, selection, and element creation.  

 The program dynamically generates pagination links and appends them to the page based on the number of students.  The max number per page is currently set to 10.
